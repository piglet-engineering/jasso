Jasso is a Single Sign-On System from Piglet Engineering

It is a modular system and currently supports:
            Source   Sink
   LDAP     yes      no
   SAML2    no       yes
   OIDC     no       yes

Unless you are actively working on Jasso, it's recommended to install via an
operating system package.  Packages are available for Debian and Ubuntu.

To build, simply use `make`.

Configuration is done entirely with flat files in the /var/lib/jasso
directory.  Example configuration files are provided in
/usr/share/doc/jasso/examples/.
